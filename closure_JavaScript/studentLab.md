### Question 1
```
const ClosureTest = () => {
  let x = 7;
}

console.log(x);
```  
In the above code, the variable  `x` is not defined. Create a function `getX()` that allows you to access the value of `x`. 

Now that you have access to that variable `x`, create a function that allows you to add one to `x` => 8.
